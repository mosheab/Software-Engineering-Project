Classifying Medical Images
============================


Classification and characterization of medical images is an important task for achieving high performance search engine of scientific papers in the medicine field.
The purpose of this project is to construct a model that uses methods for classifing images from the biomedical discipline in a hierarchical structure. This will allow retrieval of information for research purposes while reducing the search space and provides medical image retrieval for clinicians.
The classification includes a distinction between images diagnostics in radiology (medical imaging - X-ray).
<br>  Creating an automatic medical images classifier is a complex task, as its accuracy is measured by the quality and number of features that we strive to get in our model.

This project is a part of the B.Sc. in Software Engineering from "Azrieli - College of Engineering Jerusalem".
