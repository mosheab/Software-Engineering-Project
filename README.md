Classifying Medical Images
============================


Characterization and classification of medical images is an important task for achieving high performance search engine of scientific papers in medicine and life sciences.
The purpose of this project is to construct a model that uses methods for classifiy images from the biomedical field in a hierarchical way which will allow the retrieval of information for research purposes and thus allows reducing the search space .
The classification includes a distinction between images diagnostics such as radiology (medical imaging - X-ray , MRI , ultrasound) , registration of waves and signals (ECG , EMG), microscopy laboratory Images , medical photography (endoscopy) and general biomedical illustrations such as tables , statistical graphs and so on.
Creating an automatic medical images classifier is a complex task , as its accuracy is measured by the quality and number of features that we strive to get in our model.
